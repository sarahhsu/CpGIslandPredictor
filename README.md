# CpGIslandPredictor
This is a tool that will predict CpG islands across similar species using a HMM, trained using a supervised learning method or an unsupervised gradient descent method.

## Methods
Supervised learning: MLE and parameter estimation using labeled sequences <br />
Unsupervised learning: Using unlabeled sequences

## Running
First run SupervisedLearning.py to trains parameter. Then run either Supervised_ForwardBackward.py for supervised learning or Unsupervised_ForwardBackward.py for unsupervised learning.
